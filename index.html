                <p>The POEA gathered over 18,000 interested applicants from its survey on Employment Permit System-Test of Proficiency in Korean (EPS-TOPIK). This will be tha basis of the individual schedule to be assigned for those who qualify towards an orderly flow and management of the big number of workers for each day of registration. The schedule for each applicant will be strictly observed.
                <span class="spacing">Through the POEA website (http://www.poea.gov.ph), the MOEL and HRD Korea will announce shortly the specific registration dates (from Monday to Friday), Including its guidlines.Interested applicants are advised to closely monitor this development which the POEA will also post on its Facebook and Twitter accounts.</span>
                <span class="spacing">Passing the EPS-TOPIK does not guarantee employment in Koreaand will only provide the opportunity for the jobseekers to be offered an employment by Korean employers, particularly from the manufacturing sector, subject to the acceptance by the workers.</span>
                <span class="spacing">The public is forewarned against so-called advanced information on the 10th EPS-TOPIK which may be disseminated by unauthorized entities.</span>
